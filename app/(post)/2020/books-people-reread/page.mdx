I own a lot of [textbooks](https://krisyotam/library). I've often been asked why?

As it turns out, it is quite comforting to have a reference repository of useful exposition that solves problems in a number of different ways.

I took this as a opportunity to compile a list of some reference books I think every math student should own.

Here are all the books I sorted, and those frequently suggested. This is continually updated so feel free to check back. 

Email krisyotam@protonmail.com if you think you have something to add.

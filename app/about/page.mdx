# About

</a>

I&rsquo;m a B.S. student in mathematics at IU Bloomington. I&rsquo;m from
Chicago, IL, United States. In my free time, I enjoy [reading](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/krisyotam?redirect=true), watching [obscure anime](https://myanimelist.net/stacks/39037), writing([prose](https://krisyotam/categories), & [verse](https://krisyotam.com/poetry)), and 
messing around with [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html). I watch & review movies on [trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/krisyotam). On my [main blog](https://krisyotam.com), I write about 
a copious amount of topics. I enjoy spending my time with a cup of coffee, chalk, and a porcelain blackboard. A no. 2 pencil and unruled paper work too.

Looking ahead in my academic career, I am particularly interested in [Algebraic Number Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number_theory), [Algebraic Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry), [Algebraic Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology#:~:text=Algebraic%20topology%20is%20a%20branch,classify%20up%20to%20homotopy%20equivalence), and 
the intersection of these fields with Computer Science. I am not to anxious to specialize, but clarity will come with time.  I am also interested in the philosophy, and history of mathematics.

As for the site itself: everything is statically generated using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/krisyotam/mathblog).
I built math.tsx for server side rendering of LaTeX expressions. bibliography.tsx, and citation.tsx as easy reusable ways to keep track of sources, and provide a personal citation for each post.
The site was meant to be a simple, and easy to use blog for me to write about all things math. So there are no planned major changes. The base for this site is Guillermo Rauch's [experimental blog](https://github.com/rauchg/blog).
With a few add ons from [krisyotam.com](https://krisyotam.com) to make post composition easier, and more aesthetically pleasing. 
All images are outsourced to [postimg.cc](https://postimg.cc) for easy hosting, and sharing. I use Hetzner for [Large File Storage](https://www.krisyotam.com/blog/2025/krisyotam-lfs) enabling HTTPS downloads for end users, and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for DNS, and CDN.
Thanks to [tony zorman](https://tony-zorman.com/) for the idea to pregenerate LaTeX with KaTeX and embed it in the html. The math.tsx component automatically processes all LaTeX during the build process and embeds the resulting HTML directly in the page, ensuring optimal performance without sacrificing mathematical expressiveness.

## Free Software 
Free software is a big part of my life and I try to use it as much as possible. Here are some relevant reccomendations:

- [Numi](https://numi.app/): A beautiful calculator for Linux and MacOS. It has a simple interface, and allows calculations with units via [near natural language](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi/wiki).
- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/): A great open source alternative to Mathematica, and Maple. It has a [great online interface](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/) for quick calculations, and a [great community](https://ask.sagemath.org/) for help.
- [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/): I don't use arch btw. 
- [learn-c.org](https://www.learn-c.org/): A great place to learn C.
- [learn-cpp.org](https://www.learn-cpp.org/): A great place to learn C++.
- [learn-golang](https://www.learn-golang.org/): A great place to learn Go.
